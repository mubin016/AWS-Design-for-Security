# AWS-Design-for-Security
# Udacity Project - Design for Performance and Scalability
This is one of the project in Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Nanodegree.

# Project Overview
In this project, I have:

Designed, provisioned, and monitored infrastructure in AWS using industry-standard and open source tools.
Practiced the skills I have learned throughout the course to optimize infrastructure for cost and performance.
Used Terraform to provision and configure AWS services in a global configuration.
