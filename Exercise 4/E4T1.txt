Changes that can be made to our environment to prevent 
an SSH brute force attack from the internet.

1. Restricting public SSH access at the instance level.
2. Implementing password complexity requirements. 
3. Provisioning AWS WAF to prevent brute force attacks. 
4. Restricting access to certain IP addresses. 

Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised
how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?

1. Setting up s3 bucket policy to allow access from certain URL.
2. Using cloudfromt and OAI to improve restrictions. 
3. Using signed cookies for premium users.
