1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Answer: Set up WAf infront of the ALB. 

2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket

Answer: No. Creating a private gateway only allow the traffic to traverse the private AWS network making it faster only.
However, no security checks or restrictions are implemented while the traffice traverses this link. 

3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

Answer: No, AWS only encrypts the new objects after setting up default encryption for the bucket. 

4. The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?

Answer: I made these changes through the AWS console as I haven't got comfortable with using the CLI yet. 
After using the same template, all the changes will return and all the fault and non compliant findings will be reflected again on the monitoring dashboards.
